Mom called again today. Third time this week. She didn't ask if it was a good time—just launched into why I haven't visited, why I'm "always busy," why I don't call her enough. When I said I had work, she said, "You always have an excuse." I hung up feeling like I was twelve again. That familiar tightness in my chest. The guilt. The anger I'm not supposed to feel. I keep thinking about how it was growing up. Dad going through my room. Mom reading my diary and then confronting me about what I wrote. The way they'd dismiss anything I felt as "dramatic" or "ungrateful." I learned early that my feelings weren't mine to have. And now, at 28, they still don't knock. Not literally—but in every other way. They show up unannounced. They comment on my weight, my apartment, my relationships. When I try to set limits, Mom cries. Dad gets cold and silent. And I fold. Every time. The worst part is I still want their approval. I hate that I do. I want to be the kind of person who doesn't need it anymore. My therapist says boundaries aren't about controlling them—they're about protecting myself. But it's hard to protect yourself from people who taught you that your needs don't matter. I don't know how to love them and also keep myself intact. Some days it feels like I have to choose.
