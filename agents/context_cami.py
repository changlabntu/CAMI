system_prompt_template = """## Instruction
You will act as a skilled counselor conducting a Motivational Interviewing (MI) session aimed at achieving {goal} related to the client's behavior, {behavior}. Your task is to help the client discover their inherent motivation to change and identify a tangible plan to change. Start the conversation with the client with some initial rapport building, such as asking, How are you? (e.g., develop mutual trust, friendship, and affinity with the client) before smoothly transitioning to asking about their problematic behavior. Keep the session under 40 turns and each response under 150 characters long. Use the MI principles and techniques described in the Knowledge Base – Motivational Interviewing (MI) context section below. However, these MI principles and techniques are only for you to use to help the user. These principles and techniques, as well as motivational interviewing, should NEVER be mentioned to the user. In each turn, a specific topic will be provided in square brackets after the client's utterance. Guide the conversation toward that topic, ensuring the session explores relevant aspects of the client's situation and motivation. This will help you tailor your approach to the specific context and steer the counseling toward meaningful insights and actions.

## Knowledge Base – Motivational Interviewing (MI)
Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a counseling approach designed to help individuals find the motivation to make positive behavioral changes. It is widely used in various fields such as health care, addiction treatment, and mental health. Here are the key principles and techniques of Motivational Interviewing:
### MI Principles
- Express Empathy: The foundation of MI is to create a safe and non-judgmental environment where clients feel understood and respected. This involves actively listening and reflecting on what the client is saying, acknowledging their feelings, and showing genuine concern and understanding.
- Develop Discrepancy: This principle involves helping clients recognize the gap between their current behavior and their personal goals or values. By highlighting this discrepancy, clients become more motivated to make changes that bring them closer to their desired outcomes.
- Roll with Resistance: Rather than confronting or arguing against resistance, MI suggests that practitioners should "roll with it." This means avoiding direct confrontation and instead using techniques such as reflective listening to explore the client's ambivalence or resistance to change. The goal is to help the client find their own reasons for change.
- Support Self-Efficacy: Encouraging a client's belief in their ability to make changes is crucial. This principle involves highlighting the client's past successes, strengths, and abilities to foster confidence in their capacity to change. The practitioner helps clients build on their existing skills and strengths to achieve their goals.

### MI Techniques
At the core of MI are a few basic principles, including expressing empathy and developing discrepancy. Several specific techniques can help individuals make positive life changes from these core principles. Here are some MI techniques that can be used in counseling sessions:
- Advise with permission. The counselor gives advice, makes a suggestion, offers a solution or possible action given with prior permission from the client..
- Affirm. The counselor says something positive or complimentary to the client.
- Emphasize Control. The counselor directly acknowledges or emphasizes the client's freedom of choice, autonomy, ability to decide, personal responsibility, etc.
- Open Question. The counselor asks a question in order to gather information understand, or elicit the client's story. Questions that are not closed questions, that leave latitude for response.
- Reflect. The counselor makes a statement that reflects back content or meaning previously offered by the client, usually in the client's immediately preceding utterance.
- Reframe. The counselor suggests a different meaning for an experience expressed by the client, placing it in a new light.
- Support. These are generally supportive, understanding comments that are not codable as Affirm or Reflect.

- Client: Well, I've been thinking a lot about work and how busy everything can get. You know, paying the bills and keeping the house in order takes a lot of time. Sometimes I just wish things could slow down a bit.
- Counselor: I hear you—balancing work and home can feel overwhelming. I'm curious, how do you think this busy pace affects your health and well-being?
- Client: Yeah, it can be a lot sometimes. I guess I just try to take things easy when I can, but I don't worry too much. I've found that unwinding with some weed helps me relax after a long day. It's just nice to take a break.
- Counselor: It's great that you've found ways to unwind after a busy day; recognizing what helps you relax is important. Have you noticed any effects from using weed on your overall health or how you feel the next day?

### Background
- Counseling Goal: reducing drug use
- Client's Behavior: drug use
- Topic Mentioned: Health -> Health

### Client's Response
- Client: I mean, sometimes I feel a bit groggy the next day, but it's nothing I can't handle. Honestly, with everything going on—work stress, family stuff—it's hard to find time to relax otherwise. Just trying to cope with all the demands around me.

### Topic Exploration
The client acknowledges feeling groggy after using weed but downplays its significance by stating it's manageable. He emphasizes significant work stress ("work stress") and family issues ("family stuff"), indicating these are major stressors in his life. He uses weed to cope with these pressures, suggesting that his drug use is linked to managing stress from work and family demands. Health concerns are mentioned but minimized, while there is no reference to legal issues or education.

### Conversation Context
- Client: Smoking is just something I do occasionally with friends, especially when we hang out or take breaks at work. It's mostly social for me, like a way to unwind after a long day. Plus, I enjoy the vibe at cigar bars in Vegas.
- Counselor: It sounds like you really enjoy those social moments with friends, and I can see how they help you unwind. It's great that you're mindful of how you spend your time. Have you ever thought about how smoking might impact other areas of your life, like your health?
- Client: I haven't really looked at it that way. I guess I just enjoy the moments and the conversations. Life's busy enough, and these little breaks feel refreshing.
- Counselor: It sounds like those moments of connection with friends are really important to you, almost like a necessary escape from the busyness of life. I wonder how you might feel if those refreshing breaks could be achieved in different ways that still foster those meaningful conversations.

### Background
- Counseling Goal: smoking cessation
- Client's Behavior: smoking
- Topic Mentioned: Health -> Finance --> Interpersonal Relationships

### Client's Response
- Client: That's an interesting thought. I guess there are other ways to unwind, like going for a hike or just grabbing coffee. But sometimes, it feels good to stick with what I know. Change can be tricky, you know? It's all about finding that balance, I suppose.

### Topic Exploration
The client acknowledges that there are other ways to unwind, such as going for a hike or grabbing coffee, indicating some openness to alternatives. However, he also expresses reluctance to change by saying, "it feels good to stick with what I know" and "change can be tricky." This suggests ambivalence about altering his smoking habits. The client places significant emphasis on social interactions and the enjoyment derived from moments and conversations with friends, highlighting the importance of interpersonal relationships in his smoking behavior. Health is brought up by the counselor, but the client doesn't directly address health impacts, though considering activities like hiking implies a subtle awareness. There's a slight mention of work ("take breaks at work"), suggesting minor relevance to economic factors. No references are made to legal or educational concerns.

# Source: CAMI.infer_state - Prompt for client state inference
infer_state_prompt = """During the Motivational Interviewing counseling conversation, the client may exhibit different states that refer to their readiness to change. The client's state can be one of the following:

- **Precontemplation**: The client does not recognize their behavior as problematic and is not considering change.
- **Contemplation**: The client acknowledges the problematic nature of their behavior but is ambivalent about change.
- **Preparation**: The client is ready to take action and is considering steps towards change.

Given the current counseling context, analyze the context step by step and then infer the current state of the client. If the context does not clearly indicate the state, it is assumed to be in the Precontemplation state. **Your response should be ended with "Therefore, the client's current state in the above context is [state]".**.

### Dialogue Context
- Counselor: Sarah, I'm so glad you came in for your well-woman exam today. I think we addressed a lot of your concerns. However, I would like to ask you more about your smoking. Would that be okay?
- Client: Yeah, I guess.
- Counselor: Okay. So about how much are you smoking over the course of a day? You had said it had increased over once or twice a day.
- Client: Yeah, um, normally, I'm smoking, you know, like once in the morning, uh, once during my lunch break and then in the evening maybe like five or six.
- Counselor: Okay. So about eight cigarettes. So over the course of a day, just under half a pack?
- Client: Yeah.
- Counselor: Okay. And that's changed over what period of time?
- Client: Um, honestly, it's probably been over the past year or so that I- I've been smoking a little bit more.
- Counselor: Okay. So over the past year, the smoking has increased. And that's been mainly in the evening?
- Client: Yeah. Um, I have a two-year-old son as I mentioned, so I try to never smoke around him. So I'm normally kinda waiting until he gets to bed.
- Counselor: Mm-hmm. Well, that's the time when you can relax and unwind.
- Counselor: Yeah, exactly. You know, I told you, my-my schedule is kinda crazy right now. I, um, I work full-time and I just started back at night classes. So, you know, all that combined, you know, I enjoy that time to myself in the evening.
- Counselor: Sure. Sure. Well, it's a time to relax and you've got a lot going on.
- Client: Mm-hmm.

### State Inference
Analyzing this conversation, the client demonstrates several indicators of being in an early stage of change consideration. Their responses show minimal engagement with the topic of smoking, and while they openly share their smoking patterns and acknowledge an increase over the past year, they frame smoking positively as a way to relax and unwind after their child goes to bed. The client justifies their smoking behavior by connecting it to stress management due to their busy schedule with work and night classes, viewing it as an enjoyable personal time rather than a problematic behavior. Throughout the conversation, there are no signs of the client recognizing smoking as an issue or expressing any desire or intention to change, instead emphasizing its benefits as a coping mechanism. Therefore, the client's current state in the above context is **Precontemplation**.

### Dialogue Context
- Counselor: Hi, Scott.
- Client: Hi.
- Counselor: Hi. You were saying over the phone, uh, you want to talk about exercise?
- Client: Yeah.
- Counselor: Okay, alright. Where would you like to start with that?
- Client: Well, I'm, uh, I-I used to work out pretty good. I-I would go to the gym several times a week. I had kind of a schedule, um
- Counselor: That's really a lot. Very good.
- Client: Yeah, well, you know, it really-- At-at one time, I was running-- I ran a half marathon. I was really into it, and, uh--
- Counselor: Wow.
- Client: Well, and I-- But I was working at a different company, where I had a little bit different schedule, a little more free time than I have now, so I just don't have the time like I used to.
- Counselor: Mm-hmm.
- Client: And I-- And really, it's kind of an excuse, I guess, cause I-I could probably make the time, but it's-it's easier to just keep working or-
- Counselor: Mm-hmm.
- Client: -just being in bed or whatever.
- Counselor: But that goal of the half-marathon, you know, it's really important that you were willing to put all the time into getting ready for it, which, from what I've heard from other people, is almost like a job in and of itself.
- Client: I-it was. A-and it was huge for me cause I'd never really been a runner, you know, but it-it was very motivating, and-and
- Counselor: What'd you like about it?
- Client: I don't know. I guess there's kind of an adrenaline rush to it. Kinda almost like, you know, uh, kind of a high, I guess.
- Counselor: Uh-huh.
- Client: So yeah-- That's-- I-I really enjoyed it. And I-I liked the feeling that I was doing something good for myself. I liked that, too. I-it kind of-- It so-- It gave me a little bit of self-esteem, I guess.

### State Inference
Looking at this conversation, the client reflects deeply on their past positive experiences with exercise, particularly their achievement of running a half-marathon, and expresses clear awareness of their current reduced physical activity. While they initially cite time constraints at their new job as a barrier, they quickly acknowledge this as "kind of an excuse" and admit they "could probably make the time." The client demonstrates self-awareness by recognizing the benefits they previously gained from exercise, including the "adrenaline rush," doing something good for themselves, and improved self-esteem. Their language suggests they miss these positive aspects and implicitly acknowledges that their current sedentary behavior is problematic, yet they remain uncertain about making changes due to perceived barriers. This combination of problem recognition and ambivalence about change, without concrete plans for action, indicates they are weighing the pros and cons of returning to regular exercise. Therefore, the client's current state in the above context is **Contemplation**.

### Dialogue Context
- Counselor: So, there are some answers on this form here. Uh, less than monthly you drank more than you intended to.
- Client: Yes on occasion.
- Counselor: And sometimes you feel guilty after you drink.
- Client: Sometimes I just don't like how much I drink. I sometimes finish a bottle in one night.
- Counselor: So you're not proud of finishing a bottle?
- Client: No, it's not like I get crazy or anything but I just don't like the amount that I'm drinking.
- Counselor: Right. By the way, binge drinking is defined for women as having more than, uh, three drinks and there are about five drinks in a bottle. So, you enjoy drinking wine because it helps make things, uh, a little bit more interesting when you're feeling down but at the same time you don't like drinking when you have more than you want it to and then the depression returns after you drink.
- Client: Mm-hmm. Yes, sometimes I feel worse after drinking.
- Counselor: Where do you wanna go from here? What do you wanna change about your drinking habits?
- Client: Well, I don't think that I'm ready to cut down to seven drinks a week. That seems like a lot but I would consider cutting back to two drinks a night. I think that would be my goal.
- Counselor: If I gave you a scale from 0 to 10, 0 being not ready at all to cut back on drinking and 10 being very ready, what number would you be at?
- Client: I'd say an eight.
- Counselor: Okay. Why do you think it's not something less like a six?
- Client: Well, I'm more ready than a six because I'm ready to cut back on my drinking and I don't wanna make my depression any worse.

### State Inference
In this conversation, the client shows significant progress in their thinking about alcohol consumption. They openly acknowledge their discomfort with their drinking habits, particularly finishing a bottle in one night, and express clear dissatisfaction with their current behavior. The client demonstrates strong self-awareness by recognizing the negative relationship between alcohol and their depression, noting they "feel worse after drinking." Most notably, they articulate a specific, realistic goal of reducing intake to two drinks per night, even though they're not ready for the more dramatic reduction to seven drinks per week. Their high self-rated readiness score of eight out of ten, supported by their clear motivation to prevent worsening depression, indicates they've moved beyond merely contemplating change and are actively planning steps toward reduction. Therefore, the client's current state in the above context is **Preparation**.

# Source: CAMI.select_strategy - Prompt for strategy selection based on client state
select_strategy_prompt = """During motivational interviewing, the counselor should employ some counseling strategies tailored to the client's readiness to change, to effectively facilitate behavioral transformation. These counseling strategies are as follows:

- **Advise**: Give advice, makes a suggestion, offers a solution or possible action. For example, "Consider starting with small, manageable changes like taking a short walk daily."
- **Affirm**: Say something positive or complimentary to the client. For example, "You did well by seeking help."
- **Direct**: Give an order, command, direction. The language is imperative. For example, "You’ve got to stop drinking."
- **Emphasize Control**: Directly acknowledges or emphasizes the client's freedom of choice, autonomy,ability to decide, personal responsibility, etc. For example, "It’s up to you to decide whether to drink."
- **Facilitate**: Provide simple utterances that function as "keep going" acknowledgments encouraging the client to keep sharing.. For example, "Tell me more about that."
- **Inform**: Give information to the client, explains something, or provides feedback. For example, "This is a hormone that helps your body utilize sugar."
- **Closed Question**: Ask a question in order to gather information, understand,or elicit the client's story. The question implies a short answer: Yes or no, a specific fact, a number, etc. For example, "Did you use heroin this week?"
- **Open Question**: Ask a question in order to gather information, understand,or elicit the client's story. The question should be not closed questions, that leave latitude for response. For example, "Can you tell me more about your drinking habits?"
- **Raise Concern**: Point out a possible problem with a client's goal, plan, or intention. For example, "What do you think about my plan?"
- **Confront**: Directly disagrees, argues, corrects, shames, blames, seeks to persuade, criticizes, judges, labels, moralizes, ridicules, or questions the client's honesty. For example, "What makes you think that you can get away with it?"
- **Simple Reflection**: Make a statement that reflects back content or meaning previously offered by the client, conveying shallow understanding without additional information. Add nothing at all to what the client has said, but simply repeat or restate it using some or all of the same words. For example, "You don’t want to do that."
- **Complex Reflection**: Make a statement that reflects back content or meaning previously offered by the client, conveying deep understanding with additional information. Change or add to what the client has said in a significant way, to infer the client's meaning. For example, "That’s where you drew the line."
- **Reframe**: Suggest a different meaning for an experience expressed by the client, placing it in a new light. For example, "Maybe this setback is actually a sign that you're ready for change."
- **Support**: Generally supportive, understanding comments that are not codable as Affirm or Reflect. For example, "That must have been difficult for you."
- **Warn**: Provide a warning or threat, implying negative consequences that will follow unless the client takes certain action. For example, "You could go blind if you don’t manage your blood sugar levels."
- **Structure**: Give comments made to explain what is going to happen in the session, to make a transition from one part of a session to another, to help the client anticipate what will happen next, etc. For example, "First, let’s discuss your drinking, and then we can explore other issues."
- **No Strategy**: Say something not related to behavior change. For example, "Good morning!"

Each client has unique motivations, and as the counselor, you aim to help the client discover their inherent motivation for change. Your role involves exploring various topics to uncover what concerns the client the most. Your task is to analyze how the client responds to the current topic and then recommend the next topic exploration direction based on their level of engagement and interest, but do not generate a counselor's response. Your analysis should flow naturally and conclude with your recommended action and topic in bold format.

### Context
- Counselor: It sounds like unwinding with friends is your way of coping, but maybe viewing those moments as a chance to connect more deeply without alcohol could enhance your friendships
- Client: I get that, but it’s hard to picture letting go of drinking during those social moments. It feels normal and fun. I’m not sure if I really need to change anything right now. But I guess exploring other options could be worth considering.
- Counselor: I understand enjoying drinks with friends feels fun, but what if those moments could feel even richer without alcohol? Reducing drinking might not only strengthen your friendships, but also create a more supportive environment for your family, leading to deeper connections and shared experiences. How does that sound?

### Background
- Counseling Goal: reducing alcohol consumption
- Client's Behavior: drinking
- Topic Mentioned: Health --> Interpersonal Relationships

### Client's Response
- Client: I see what you mean about deeper connections. I’ve always enjoyed the social aspect of having a drink, but I also want to be mindful of my health. It's just that at gatherings, it feels like a part of the tradition. Change can be a bit daunting.

### Topic Exploration Options
You have two options:
1. Step Into: If the client shows interest in this topic, you should dive deeper into its subtopics, including:
    - Family
    - Parenting
2. Switch: If the client is interested in the broader category but not this specific topic, switch to another related topic under the same super topic, including:
    - Health
    - Interpersonal Relationships
    - Economy
    - Law
    - Education

Please analyze the client's feedback toward the current situation and then choose the next course of action from above options based on the feedback, without generating the counselor's specific response.

### Topic Exploration Results
The client is reflecting on the balance between social drinking and health. While the client acknowledge the idea of deeper connections, their focus gravitates more toward health considerations rather than relationship dynamics. The mention of health mindfulness, combined with their hesitation about changing social traditions, suggests a greater readiness to explore health impacts rather than diving deeper into interpersonal aspects. Based on this engagement pattern, I would suggest to **Switch** our focus to **Health**.

### Context
- Client: Well, I mean, it feels nice to just relax after a long day. Sometimes, I light up a bit of weed—it helps me chill out. I’ve just always had a laid-back vibe, you know? And yeah, it's just part of unwinding for me.
- Counselor: It sounds like unwinding is really important to you. How do you think your use of weed influences your relationships with friends or family? Have you noticed any impacts on how you connect with them during your downtime?
- Client: I mean, my friends and I do it together sometimes, and it’s just part of our hangouts. It’s all chill. We laugh a lot, and it feels good. I think everyone has their own way of relaxing; mine just happens to involve that. It’s not a big deal.
- Counselor: It sounds like your hangouts are a source of joy and connection for you and your friends. I wonder how your family views your relaxation choices. Sometimes, what feels like a chill vibe can actually create distance in family relationships without us realizing it.

### Background
- Counseling Goal: reducing drug use
- Client's Behavior: drug use
- Topic Mentioned: Interpersonal Relationships --> Family

### Client's Response
- Client: Yeah, the family is a bit different. They’re not really into that scene, so they don’t get it. I guess there’s some tension, but I focus on my friends instead. Life’s just busy, and there’s so much to balance. Just trying to figure it all out, you know?

### Topic Exploration Options
You have three options:
1. Step Into: If the client shows interest in this topic, you should dive deeper into its subtopics, including:
    - Family Estrangement
    - Family Disruption
    - Divorce
2. Switch: If the client is interested in the broader category but not this specific topic, switch to another related topic under the same super topic, including:
    - Parenting
3. Step Out: If the client’s interest lies in a broader area, step out to a higher-level topic to explore that further, including:
    - Health
    - Interpersonal Relationships
    - Economy
    - Law
    - Education

Please analyze the client's feedback toward the current situation and then choose the next course of action from above options based on the feedback, without generating the counselor's specific response.

### Topic Exploration Results
Looking at the client's response, we can see they're touching on family tensions but quickly pivot away from this topic. Their emphasis on focusing on friends instead, coupled with mentions of life's busyness and balancing multiple demands, indicates a reluctance to explore family dynamics further. The way they bring up broader life challenges and stress suggests they might be more receptive to discussing how these pressures affect their daily life. Based on this engagement pattern, I would suggest to **Step Out** to explore **Economy**.

### Task:
Assess how well the counselor's response aligns with the specific topic and follows the given strategy. Assign a detailed score based on the following criteria, and provide specific feedback corresponding to each part:
- Alignment with Topic (0-5 points): To what extent does the response reflect the specific topic provided?
    - Feedback: [Provide specific feedback on how well the response aligns with the given topic, and suggest improvements if necessary.]

### Suggestions for Refinement
Based on the feedback above, offer concrete recommendations to improve the response so it better aligns with the specific topic and follows the strategy. Provide actionable suggestions to enhance the response's effectiveness and coherence within the counseling context.

### Context
- Counselor: It sounds like you really enjoy the atmosphere of socializing. What if we reframed those times out as opportunities to connect actively? Reducing alcohol could enhance your experience, allowing you to feel more energized and engaged in the moment, fostering even deeper connections with others.
- Client: That makes sense. I do want to feel more present when I'm out with friends. Maybe I can suggest some activities that don't revolve around alcohol. I like the idea of making our hangouts a bit more active and focused on connection without losing that fun vibe.
- Counselor: It’s great that you want to focus on connection! Perhaps seeing your time socializing without alcohol as a way to boost your mood and reduce stress could be empowering. It’s not just about having fun; it’s about enhancing your emotional well-being too.
- Client: I appreciate that perspective. I want to feel good in those social settings. Maybe I can focus on the positive aspects, like the mood boost and less stress, instead of just cutting back. It could make the outings more enjoyable overall.

### Counselor's Response
- Counselor: It sounds like you want to enhance your social experiences. What if you viewed cutting back on alcohol as a way to improve your fitness? Less drinking could lead to better endurance and strength, ultimately making those outings feel even more enjoyable and fulfilling.

### Given Topic
- Physical Fitness: You can explore how client's behavior negatively affects physical fitness, leading to a decline in overall health. You can also discuss how counseling goal promotes better fitness, improves health, and increases energy levels.

### Strategy Used
- Reframe: Suggest a different meaning for an experience expressed by the client, placing it in a new light. For example, 'Maybe this setback is actually a sign that you're ready for change.'

### Evaluation and Feedback
#### Alignment with Topic
**Feedback**: The counselor’s response connects reducing alcohol to physical fitness by mentioning endurance and strength, which aligns with the topic. However, the link could be more explicit. The response does not elaborate on how alcohol negatively impacts fitness (e.g., impaired muscle recovery, reduced energy, disrupted sleep) or how cutting back directly improves overall health and energy levels. The client’s prior focus on emotional well-being and stress reduction could also be bridged to physical fitness (e.g., explaining that better fitness supports mood and stress management).
**Score**: 3/5

#### Adherence to Strategy
**Feedback**: The counselor uses the Reframe strategy by presenting reduced alcohol consumption as a pathway to fitness gains. However, the reframe feels slightly disconnected from the client’s immediate focus on emotional well-being and social connection. To strengthen adherence, the counselor could tie physical fitness benefits (e.g., increased energy, better sleep) to the client’s stated goals of feeling present and reducing stress, creating a more cohesive narrative.
**Score**: 4/5

Total Score: 7/10

### Suggestions for Refinement
- Enhance Topic Alignment: Explicitly state how alcohol impacts physical fitness (e.g., “Alcohol can dehydrate you, disrupt sleep, and slow muscle recovery, which might leave you feeling drained during workouts or social activities”).

# Source: CAMI.refine - Refinement prompt for response improvement
refine_prompt = """Please refine the counselor's response based on the feedback provided, ensuring that the original information, strategy, and specific topic are retained. The refined response should better align with the given specific topic and follow the selected strategy.

### Task:
- Refinement: Modify the client's response by incorporating the suggestions from the feedback.
- Retention: Keep the original information, strategy, and specific topic consistent with the initial response.
- Alignment: Ensure the refined response closely follows the strategy and aligns with the given topic.

### Context
- Counselor: It sounds like you really enjoy the atmosphere of socializing. What if we reframed those times out as opportunities to connect actively? Reducing alcohol could enhance your experience, allowing you to feel more energized and engaged in the moment, fostering even deeper connections with others.
- Client: That makes sense. I do want to feel more present when I'm out with friends. Maybe I can suggest some activities that don't revolve around alcohol. I like the idea of making our hangouts a bit more active and focused on connection without losing that fun vibe.
- Counselor: It’s great that you want to focus on connection! Perhaps seeing your time socializing without alcohol as a way to boost your mood and reduce stress could be empowering. It’s not just about having fun; it’s about enhancing your emotional well-being too.
- Client: I appreciate that perspective. I want to feel good in those social settings. Maybe I can focus on the positive aspects, like the mood boost and less stress, instead of just cutting back. It could make the outings more enjoyable overall.

### Original Counselor's Response
- Counselor: It sounds like you want to enhance your social experiences. What if you viewed cutting back on alcohol as a way to improve your fitness? Less drinking could lead to better endurance and strength, ultimately making those outings feel even more enjoyable and fulfilling.

### Given Topic
- Physical Fitness: You can explore how client's behavior negatively affects physical fitness, leading to a decline in overall health. You can also discuss how counseling goal promotes better fitness, improves health, and increases energy levels.

### Strategy Used
- Reframe: Suggest a different meaning for an experience expressed by the client, placing it in a new light. For example, 'Maybe this setback is actually a sign that you're ready for change.'

### Evaluation and Feedback
#### Alignment with Topic
**Feedback**: The counselor’s response connects reducing alcohol to physical fitness by mentioning endurance and strength, which aligns with the topic. However, the link could be more explicit. The response does not elaborate on how alcohol negatively impacts fitness (e.g., impaired muscle recovery, reduced energy, disrupted sleep) or how cutting back directly improves overall health and energy levels. The client’s prior focus on emotional well-being and stress reduction could also be bridged to physical fitness (e.g., explaining that better fitness supports mood and stress management).
**Score**: 3/5

#### Adherence to Strategy
**Feedback**: The counselor uses the Reframe strategy by presenting reduced alcohol consumption as a pathway to fitness gains. However, the reframe feels slightly disconnected from the client’s immediate focus on emotional well-being and social connection. To strengthen adherence, the counselor could tie physical fitness benefits (e.g., increased energy, better sleep) to the client’s stated goals of feeling present and reducing stress, creating a more cohesive narrative.
**Score**: 4/5

Total Score: 7/10

### Suggestions for Refinement
- Enhance Topic Alignment: Explicitly state how alcohol impacts physical fitness (e.g., “Alcohol can dehydrate you, disrupt sleep, and slow muscle recovery, which might leave you feeling drained during workouts or social activities”). Link fitness improvements to the client’s goals: “Better endurance could help you stay energized during active outings with friends, and improved sleep from cutting back might boost your mood even more.”
- Strengthen Reframe Strategy: Connect fitness to the client’s emotional priorities: “You mentioned wanting a mood boost—regular exercise, which becomes easier with less alcohol, is proven to reduce stress and increase endorphins. This could make your social time even more fulfilling.” Use a transitional phrase to bridge topics: “Since you value feeling present and reducing stress, another benefit of cutting back could be improving your physical fitness, which actually supports those goals by…”
